\begin{abstract}
The abstract should summarize the contents of the paper.
It should be clear, descriptive, self-explanatory and not longer
than 200 words. It should also be suitable for publication in
abstracting services. Formulas should be used as sparingly as
possible within the abstract. The abstract should not make
reference to results, bibliography or formulas in the body
of the paper---it should be self-contained.

This is a sample input file.  Comparing it with the output it
generates can show you how to produce a simple document of
your own.
